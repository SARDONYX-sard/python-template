## Language

Git branch names, commit messages, and GitHub pull requests must be written in English so that developers around the world can read them.

## Git branch flow

- The [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) is used for the development of this project.

- Anything in the `main` branch is deployable.

- To work on something new, you create a branch and add `feature/` as a prefix to its name.

- The branch name should start with a verb and be as concise and clear as possible.

```bash
# Example
feature/implement-xxx
feature/support-xxx-for-xxx
feature/fix-xxx-bugs
```

See here for more details.
